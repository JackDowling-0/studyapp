I got really annoyed that there was no way to create flashcards in bulk, so I'm making this project.

Users should be able to use the CLI (and later UI) to upload text in bulk that will be parsed and converted into flashcards. The flashcards are then stored in memory to save between sessions.

Currently undergoing a class rework, but should hopefully be done by the end of December.

This project is not done.
