I got really annoyed that there was no way to create flashcards in bulk, so I made this project.

Code is available in libs, but all you need to run the program is an empty folder. The program will generate a library batch upload file automatically.

Follow the instructions in the CLI to use the program, you should be able to quit back to the main menu at any time by pressing 'q' or pressing enter a few times.

There will be some bugs and it's not the prettiest, but it does generally work as intended.

At some point I will wrap the program in a graphics layer to make it a little clunky to use.

Some info:
-statically compiled with GCC/g++
-written in C++
-approximately 800 lines of code
-about two months of work including a rework from a C based prototype to C++.
-I wish I knew about goto loops earlier, it probably would've saved me about a month of work
-Program is built for Windows. As a result, the "bulk upload" option likely won't work on most Linux distros.
